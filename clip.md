## Paper 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00020.pdf


## Introduction/Related Works

## Training
- trains 5 Resnets and 3 Vision Transformers
- usnig Resnet50, Resnet101, and 3 more that follow EfficientNet-style model scaling
- As well as ViT-B/32, ViT-B/16, ViT-L/14
- Using Adam optimizier
- used grid search, random search, and manual tuning for hyperparameters
